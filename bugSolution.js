The solution involves ensuring all dependencies are updated to versions compatible with React 19.  If updating isn't immediately possible, manual adjustments might be needed.  For instance, you might have to adjust how you handle state updates or lifecycle methods to align with React 19's concurrent mode or automatic batching.  Additionally, carefully review any warnings or error messages during the upgrade process; they often provide crucial clues for fixing incompatibility issues.
